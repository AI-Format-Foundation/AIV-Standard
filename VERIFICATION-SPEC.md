# AI FIRST EXCHANGE — VERIFICATION SPECIFICATION (AIFX-VS)
Version 1.0 • 2025  
Applies to: AIFM, AIFV, AIFI, AIFP Standards

---

## 1. Purpose of Verification

The **AI First Exchange Verification System (AIFX-VS)** establishes graduated
**trust tiers** for AI-first media by documenting **declared provenance,
creator identity signals, and metadata integrity**.

This specification defines verification levels, badge semantics, required
manifest fields, and validation workflows across all AIFX formats.

AIFX-VS is designed to:
- Improve transparency of declared content origin
- Signal creator identity confidence
- Preserve metadata integrity
- Enable ecosystem-wide trust indicators
- Remain compatible with future platform integrations

AIFX-VS **does not guarantee legal authorship, ownership, or absolute origin**.
It records and signals documented workflow context only.

## 2. Verification Tiers

### 🟡 Tier 1 — Self-Declared Authenticity (SDA)
**Badge:** 🟡 SDA  
**Trust Level:** Low  

**Requirements:**
- Creator manually supplies metadata
- No email or identity verification
- No platform signal

**Intended for:**
- Early-stage creators
- Offline or experimental workflows
- Basic format conversions

**Required Manifest Fields:**
```json
"verification": {
  "trust_level": "self-declared",
  "method": "manual-entry",
  "verified_email": false,
  "platform_signal": false,
  "signature": null
}
🔵 Tier 2 — Verified Creator (VC)
Badge: 🔵 VC
Trust Level: Medium

Requirements:

Verified email address

Human authorship statement signed

Optional OAuth authentication

Cryptographic hash recorded in manifest

Intended for:

Professional creators

Monetized content

Portfolio and publishing workflows

Required Manifest Fields:

json
Copy code
"verification": {
  "trust_level": "creator-verified",
  "method": "email-and-signature",
  "verified_email": true,
  "platform_signal": false,
  "signature": "sha256-hash"
}
🟢 Tier 3 — Platform Verified Authenticity (PVA)
Badge: 🟢 PVA
Trust Level: High

Requirements:

Metadata validated via trusted platform or pipeline signal

Prompt, model, and timestamp confirmation where supported

Optional cryptographic signing (future-compatible)

Intended for:

Platform-verified AI media

Enterprise or compliance-sensitive workflows

Legal-adjacent use cases

Required Manifest Fields:

json
Copy code
"verification": {
  "trust_level": "platform-verified",
  "method": "platform-signal",
  "verified_email": true,
  "platform_signal": "suno | veo | runway | other",
  "signature": "base64-signature"
}
Platform verification depends on tool support and does not imply universal
verification across all generators.

3. Verification Metadata Fields
All AIFX formats MAY include the following optional fields:

json
Copy code
"verification_notes": "",
"reviewed_by": "",
"verification_version": "1.0"
4. Verification Workflows
🟡 Self-Declared Workflow
Creator supplies metadata

Converter packages AIFX file

Manifest stored without signing

Badge assigned: SDA

🔵 Verified Creator Workflow
Creator authenticates

Email verified

Authorship statement signed

Signature hash recorded

Manifest updated

Badge assigned: VC

🟢 Platform Verified Workflow
Creator provides platform reference ID

Trusted signal or API metadata retrieved

Metadata validated

Optional signature verified

Manifest updated

Badge assigned: PVA

5. Badge Display Rules
SDA: Displayed universally; lowest discovery priority

VC: Displayed with creator identity; eligible for monetization

PVA: Displayed prominently; eligible for premium and enterprise contexts

Badges represent trust tier, not creative quality or legal status.

6. Security & Anti-Fraud Considerations
Signed manifest fields MUST remain immutable

Hash-based signatures prevent silent tampering

Verification decisions SHOULD be logged by converter tools

Blockchain anchoring MAY be supported in future versions

Fraudulent badge claims may result in revocation

7. Future Extensions (v2.0 Roadmap)
Public-key verification registry

Signature revocation mechanisms

Federated verification authorities

Optional blockchain timestamp anchoring

Cross-platform verification bridges

8. Compliance Statement
Implementations that fully adhere to this specification may display the:

AIFX Verification Mark (AVM)
Verification Specification v1.0

Non-compliant tools MUST NOT claim verification alignment or display AIFX badges.

9. Changelog
v1.0 — Initial Release

Defines SDA, VC, and PVA tiers

Establishes verification schema

Specifies badge semantics

Introduces integrity-first trust model

Fully aligned with AIFX standards
